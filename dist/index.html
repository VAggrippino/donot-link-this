    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Community services like Facebook and Twitter take plain text as input
      and turn them into links to relevant content based on commonly used
      patterns. Three words separated only by dots is treated as a link to a
      website. An "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign"
      target="_blank">at sign</a>" followed by a word is treated as a link to
      a user name or pseudonym. And a "<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign" target="_blank">number
      sign</a>" (#) is treated as a link to a concept stream, also known as a
      hashtag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, the automatic linking performed by these services is not
      intended by the author of the content.
    </p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      This tool is an attempt to
      correct the problem by inserting a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space"
      target="_blank">zero-width space</a> after certain characters. This
      character, which is not visible, disrupts the pattern without changing
      the appearance of the text.
    </p>
    <h2>What services does this work with?</h2>
    <p>
      Since inserting a non-displayed character invalidates the URL, this
      should work with any service that automatically transform a text string
      containing a URL into a clickable link. However, some services simply
      strip out the non-displayed characters. I've tested this with a few
      services, and here's the result:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Service</th> <th>Works?</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Facebook</td> <td class="yes">Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Twitter</td> <td class="yes">Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>WhatsApp</td> <td class="no">no</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Telegram</td> <td class="yes">Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GitHub</td> <td class="yes">Yes</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
