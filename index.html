    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Community services like Facebook and Twitter take plain text as input
      and turn them into links to relevant content based on commonly used
      patterns. Three words separated only by dots is treated as a link to a
      website. An "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign"
      target="_blank">at sign</a>" followed by a word is treated as a link to
      a user name or pseudonym. And a "<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign" target="_blank">number
      sign</a>" (#) is treated as a link to a concept stream, also known as a
      hashtag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, the automatic linking performed by these services is not
      intended by the author of the content.
    </p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      This tool is an attempt to
      correct the problem by inserting a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space"
      target="_blank">zero-width space</a> after certain characters. This
      character, which is not visible, disrupts the pattern without changing
      the appearance of the text.

    <h2>Demo:</h2>
    <div class="example">
      <form action="#" method="post" onsubmit="return false;">
        <textarea class="example__input">After I start building my subdomains out like http://code.example.com?opt1=yes&opt2=no, I'm going to code.example.com pre-order my lunch @McDowells by calling #hashtag #4005.</textarea>
        <div class="example__output"></div>
        <div class="example__buttons">
